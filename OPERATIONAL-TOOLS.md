# PH4NTXM-LITE — Operational Tools

## Overview

This document lists the operational tools included in the default PH4NTXM-LITE runtime environment.

All operational tooling integrated into PH4NTXM-LITE is presented with custom-designed PH4NTXM-LITE application icons for consistent visual identification inside the environment. These tools exist only within the live runtime session and are not persistently installed.

Tool availability may vary depending on build configuration, runtime profile, or operational requirements.
